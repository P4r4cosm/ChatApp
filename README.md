# Chat App using TLS

This is a console chat messenger that uses TLS for encryption. The application follows a client-server architecture. The client sends messages to the server, which saves them to a PostgreSQL database and forwards them to another client. The recipient client can read the message and reply.
### The server uses encryption to store passwords, which are saved in the database in encrypted form. The server can handle multiple clients concurrently.

For database operations, the application uses Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore. Password encryption is implemented via System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates, while TLS communication is enabled using System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient, System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener, and System.Net.Security.SslStream.
